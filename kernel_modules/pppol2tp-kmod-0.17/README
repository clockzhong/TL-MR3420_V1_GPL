This PPPoL2TP kernel driver was derived from an early version written
by Martijn van Oosterhout <kleptog@svana.org>. The original version
can be obtained from

http://svana.org/kleptog/kl2tp/kl2tp-0.2.tar.gz

The kernel PPPoL2TP module may be built here for convenience. However,
it is recommended that the module is built in a kernel source tree
using one of the patches in the patches subdirectory.

If you do want to build your PPPoL2TP module here, make sure that
KERNEL_SRCDIR and KERNEL_VERSION are properly defined. See the
makefile.

For systems with 2.6 kernels, the makefile derives the kernel version
and the location of its sources. It automatically derives the correct
compile flags for the module to be compatible with the kernel. Things
are a little more complicated for 2.4 - the builder must specify
KERNEL_VERSION=2.4 and KERNEL_SRCDIR manually.

For installation instructions, see INSTALL in this directory.
