This file is a history of changes made in each release.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.17, 13-AUG-2007

IMPORTANT: THIS RELEASE HAS A KERNEL API CHANGE. 

- Change SOL_PPPOL2TP value for all kernel versions to the value now
  assigned in the official kernel tree. This change lets us release 
  openl2tpd ready for the official kernel driver which will appear in
  the 2.6.23 kernel. There are no functional changes.

- Add a pppol2tp kernel driver patch for kernel 2.6.22.

- Update out-of-tree pppol2tp_v26.c driver to compile for 2.6.22.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.16, 28-MAY-2007

IMPORTANT: THIS RELEASE HAS A KERNEL API CHANGE. 

- Reorder some fields in the structure returned by PPPIOCGL2TPSTATS
  ioctl such that it is identical for 32-bit and 64-bit
  architectures. This fixes binary compatibility problems for
  32/64-bit userspace apps.

- Add a pppol2tp kernel driver patch for kernel 2.6.21.

- Add RPMs for FC5/FC6 2.6.20 and 2.6.21 kernel updates.

- Update debian package directory. Debian packages coming soon!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.15, 26-FEB-2007

- Add a pppol2tp kernel driver patch for kernel 2.6.20. Also fix
  out-of-tree pppol2tp kernel module for compiling for 2.6.20.

- Add RPMs for FC5 2.6.18 and 2.6.19 kernel updates.

- Fix a makefile bug found by Christian Wiese (morfoh@opensde.org)
  where if_pppol2tp.h was not added to the list of installed headers
  which are installed by "make headers_install" when building the
  kernel. This change is for the kernel patches from 2.6.18 onwards
  when the headers_install build target was added.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.14, 2-DEC-2006

- Apply a patch from michal.ruzicka@comstar.cz to the 2.6 driver to fix
  use with IPSEC through NAT gateways.

- Add a patch for kernel 2.6.19.

- Remove the #include <linux/config.h> from the 2.6.18 patch and
  conditionally from the out-of-tree pppol2tp_v26.c driver. From
  2.6.18 onwards, config.h is included via a gcc "-include" directive.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.13, 8-OCT-2006

- Add workaround to missing export of pppox_ioctl in pre-2.6.16
  kernels.  Although this missing export error was corrected by some
  distros in their early 2.6 kernels, several people are using
  standard (kernel.org) kernels. The pppol2tp kernel module tries to
  use pppox_ioctl() so for kernels before 2.6.16, we now use
  pppol2tp_ioctl directly and duplicate some of the code from
  pppox_ioctl.

- Apply Cedric Schieli's netfilter patch to the 2.4 kernel driver.

- Add 2.6.18 kernel patch.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.12, 17-SEP-2006

- Import patch from schieli@users.sf.net to fix a problem when using
  netfilter.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.11, 26-AUG-2006

- Separate out the kernel PPPoL2TP module from the main OpenL2TP
  release.

- Add a kernel patch for 2.6.17 kernels.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Earlier releases were included in the OpenL2TP package.
