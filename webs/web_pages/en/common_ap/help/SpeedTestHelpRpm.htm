<H1>Speed Test Help</H1>
<p>The <B>Speed Test</B> is dedicated for testing the connection speed to and from any reachable IP address on current network,
	especially when we are building wireless network between devices which are far away from each other.It should be used for the 
	preliminary throughput estimation between two network devices. The estimation is rough.You can input the remote device's 
	administrator Username and Password under <B>Advance options</B> to get a precise estimation if the remote device is <B>WA5110G</B> too.
	</P>

<p><B>Destination IP</B>: The Remote device's IP address.</p>
<p><B>Advanced options</B>: This is a switch to show advanced test options which are used only for precise estimation.</p>
<p><B>User</B>: Administrator Username of the remote device.It should be filled correctly if you want to get a precise estimation. Otherwise, keep it clean.</p>
<p><B>Password</B>: Administrator Password of the remote device.It should be filled correctly if you want to get a precise estimation. Otherwise, keep it clean.</p>
<p><B>Note</B>: If either User or Password is incorrect , we will take a basic test instead.In other words, none of the advance options you set will take effect. </p>
<p><B>Direction</B>: There are 3 options available for the traffic direction while estimating the throughput.</p>
<ul>
<lI><B>transmit</B> - Estimate the outgoing throughput (Tx).</lI>
<lI><B>receive</B> - Estimate the ingoing throughput (Rx).</lI>
<lI><B>both &nbsp;</B> - Estimate the incoming (Rx) first and then the outgoing (Tx) afterwards.</lI>
</ul>
<p><B>Duration</B>: The value you specify here indicate how much time the test should last.</p>
<p><B>Data amount</B>: The maximal data amount to be sent out during the whole test.</p>
<p><B>Note</B>: If both <b>Duration</b> and <b>Data amount</b> are specified, the test will stop after any of them is met.</p>
<P>Be sure to click the <B>Run Test</B> button to start a new test after you filled enough information. You can also stop
	a running test by click <B>Stop Test</B> button at any time.</P>
